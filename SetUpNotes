Below are the highlight of refactoring I have done

1) Dependency of mock class can be removed as Testing for any class should be done in isolation.
2) I have added mockito dependency to have mocked data.
3) I have introduced Interface for DOA layer. this helpful in unit testing and provide flexibility in actual code.
4) I have introduced new data structure which provides uniques ness along with indexing. feature of set and list interface.
5) detail of underlying collection is hidden now. client do not bother how playlist is implemented internally.
6) there were few bugs.test cases have been written for that anf bugs are fixed now.
7) performance of add method is improved significantly.


Below are few thought about problem.

1) Mocking framwork can be added in place of mock class.
2) some more details regarding objects can be mentioned. as which fields are unique for track or playlist track.


Overall,  I enjoyed the refactoring process.
